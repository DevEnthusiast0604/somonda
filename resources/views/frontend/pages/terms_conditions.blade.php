                    <h4>Returning products</h4>
                    <p>If you wish to return your order, please do so without undue delay (7 days at the latest after
                        notifying us of your decision to return your purchase). You are required to cover any expenses
                        related to returned products. It is your responsibility to make sure that any products that are
                        to be returned are securely packed.</p>

                    <h4> The conditions of returned products.</h4>
                    <p>Any depreciation in value related to product use that is improper or different from its intended
                        use and function is paid for by the customer. However, if you damage the product through misuse
                        or carelessness and seek reimbursement, you may end up receiving only a small part or none of
                        the purchase price back if you return it, depending on the commercial value of the product(s) in
                        question and the nature of the given incident.</p>
                    <p>In the case of products, the original packaging can play a significant part in determining the
                        value of the product(s) in question. We therefore encourage you to send items in an undamaged
                        condition.</p>

                    <h4>Refund of purchase price</h4>
                    <p>If you cancel your purchase, you are entitled to a full refund of the money you paid us. In case
                        of depreciation related to improper product use or carelessness, the purchase price is
                        subtracted.</p>
                    <p>If you exercise your cancellation right, we refund all payments received, including any prepaid
                        delivery expenses. However, additional expenses resulting from your own choice of delivery
                        methods that differ from the cheapest standard delivery option that we offer, are not refunded.
                        Payment is made without undue delay and under all circumstances, 14 days at the latest from the
                        date on which we receive notice of your decision to cancel your purchase. Refunds are issued in
                        the same format as the original payment method.</p>
                    <p>We reserve the right to withhold your refund until we have received the products that are to be
                        returned, unless you can provide proper documentation to this effect.</p>
                    <p>If you wish to cancel your purchase, send your product (s) to:</p>
